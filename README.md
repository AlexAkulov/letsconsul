# Letsconsul

**STATUS:** *prototyping/experimental*

Tool that helps you automatically renew LetsEncrypt certificates and serve them in consul K/V storage.

*Note: It is tightly integrated with proxy-server (nginx in this case) and `consul-template` tool. Please read below for full understanding of certificate issuing and installation process.*

## Get started

At first create following K/V structure in Consul:

```
letsconsul
|_
|  \_domains
|    |_
|    | \_example.com
|    |   |_
|    |   | \_domain_list = ["www.example.com", "example.com"]
|    |   |_
|    |   | \_email = admin@example.com
|    |   |_
|    |   | \_timestamp = 0
|    |   |_
|    |   | \_cert =
|    |   |_
|    |   | \_chain =
|    |   |_
|    |     \_fullchain =
|    |_
|      \_qlean.ru
|        |_
|        | \_domain_list = ["qlean.ru", "www.qlean.ru", "assets.qlean.ru"]
|        |_
|        | \email = webmaster@qlean.ru
|        |_
|        | \_timestamp = 0
|        |_
|        | \_cert =
|        |_
|        | \_chain =
|        |_
|          \_fullchain =
|_
  \_domains_enabled = ["example.com", "qlean.ru"]
```

When letsconsul starting it reading particular environment variables:

- `BIND` - host:port variable that server will listen (e.g BIND=0.0.0.0:21234)
- `RENEW_INTERVAL` - domain certificate expiration time (e.g. RENEW_INTERVAL=168h)
- `RELOAD_INTERVAL` - time after letsconsul reloading domains information from consul (e.g. RELOAD_INTERVAL=10s)
- `CONSUL_SERVICE` - consul service name and  k/v folder where domains serving (e.g. CONSUL_SERVICE=letsconsul)

Example of usage:

```
$ go build
$ BIND=0.0.0.0:21234 RENEW_INTERVAL=168h RELOAD_INTERVAL=10s CONSUL_SERVICE=letsconsul letsencrypt
```

After app starts, it fetching domains information from consul by given `CONSUL_SERVICE` env variable, checking certificate expiration time and if more than `RENEW_INTERVAL` then starts certificate renew process.
